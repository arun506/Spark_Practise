Matei Zaharia, the creator of Spark and CTO of commercial Spark developer Databricks, shared his views on the Spark phenomena, as well as several real-world use cases, during his presentation at the recent Strata conference in Santa Clara, California.
Since its introduction in 2010, Spark has caught on very quickly, and is now one of the most active open source Hadoop projects–if not the most active. “In the past year Spark has actually overtaken Hadoop MapReduce and every other engine we’re aware of in terms of the number of people contributing to it,” Zaharia says. “It’s an interesting thing. There hasn’t been as much noise about it commercially, but the actual developer community votes with its feet and people are actually getting things done and working with the project.”
Zaharia argues that Spark is catching on so quickly because of two factors: speed and sophistication. “Achieving the best speed and the best sophistication have usually required separate non-commodity tools that don’t run on these commodity clusters. [They’re] often proprietary and quite expensive,” says Zaharia, a 5th year Ph.D. candidate who is also an assistant professor of computer science at MIT.
